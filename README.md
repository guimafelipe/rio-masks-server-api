# Rio Maks
This is a project to try to map people and stores selling masks in Rio de Janeiro and neighbour cities.
I tried to insert initial ones that I know and created a form for other people to insert new ones.

## How it works
In the website, there is a map where you can navigate and see people selling masks around Rio de Janeiro city.
You can search for your address in the search bar so the map zooms in your area.

If you know some place selling mask too, fill in the form below the map. I will receive this informations and confirm them with
the seller before it goes online and appears in the map too.

There are no money involved so the project is entirely open source and without any finantial outcomes.
